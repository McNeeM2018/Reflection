This week we learned about encryption and multiple ways to do it. Encryption is a way of coding and decoding a message. To correctly receive the message you must have the key. To make encryption stronger or more challenging to decode you can encrypt it multiple times by switching letters around or substituting letters for symbols or numbers. A specific type of cipher that we learned about is the Caesar shift cipher in which letters shift either to the right or left. This cipher can be done multiple times to make it harder to crack.
